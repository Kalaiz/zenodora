## ✍️ Reflection
- Learned about TDD practices of [red green refactor](https://youtu.be/WW5TL7070xU?t=493). Although TDD practices may take some time upfront [it saves more time and the hassle of dealing with bugs](https://youtu.be/WW5TL7070xU?t=894) in the long run. Also I felt that it made me slightly stress free as I did not get distracted and the need to over engineer the things, due to the nature of a TDD rule, mentioned by [Uncle Bob](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Robert_C._Martin), which states to [write only enough production code to make the failing unit test pass](https://www.freecodecamp.org/news/test-driven-development-what-it-is-and-what-it-is-not-41fa6bca02a2/#rules-of-the-game:~:text=%2D%20You%20are%20not%20allowed%20to%20write%20any%20more%20production,pass%20the%20one%20failing%20unit%20test.).
- Had to make a opensourced android view,[Waveview](https://github.com/john990/WaveView), [customisable](https://github.com/john990/WaveView/pulls). However, the owner archived the repo just after I pulled a few [PRs](https://github.com/john990/WaveView/pulls); Seems like it has been unmaintained for quite some time :( . Currently using the customised view sourcecode for the Waveview.
